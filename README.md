## Bin Chicken

This is the code for [Bin Chicken](https://binchicken.one), a website for learning logic.
It's built on the [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.org) framework, in [Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org).
The site will probably make little sense unless you have [Ellie Ripley](https://negation.rocks)'s logic notes; write to me for a current copy, if you like!
